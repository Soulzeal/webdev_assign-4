    <!-- ðŸ’¡ Q.1 Explain Hoisting in JavaScript -->
    <!-- Answer - In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations
         are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the
          code is executed. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are 
          declared in the code, they are conceptually moved to the top of their respective scopes. 
          Hoisting affects both variable and function declarations, but it is important to note
           that only the declarations themselves are hoisted, not the initializations or 
           assignments.-->

<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.2** Explain Temporal Dead Zone? -->
<!-- Answer - The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior that occurs with variables declared 
    using the let and const keywords in JavaScript. It refers to the period in the code before
     a variable is declared where trying to access or assign a value to that variable results 
     in a ReferenceError.
    The TDZ ensures that variables are not accessed before they are declared, which helps to
    catch potential programming errors and promotes better coding practices -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.3** Difference between var & let? -->
<!-- Answer - In JavaScript, var and let are both used to declare variables, but they have some
     key differences
    1) Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible
     throughout the entire function in which they are declared, regardless of block boundaries
     . On the other hand, variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are 
     only accessible within the nearest enclosing block 
    2) Hoisting: Both var and let are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes during the
     compilation phase. However, variables declared with var are initialized with a value of
      undefined at the beginning of their scope, while variables declared with let remain
       uninitialized-->



<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.4** What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6? -->
<!-- Answer - ES6 comes with significant changes to the JavaScript language. It brought 
    several new features like, let and const keyword, rest and spread operators, template
    literals, classes, modules and many other enhancements to make JavaScript programming 
    easier and more fun. In this article, we will discuss some of the best and most popular
    ES6 features that we can use in your everyday JavaScript coding.

let and const Keywords
Arrow Functions
Multi-line Strings
Default Parameters
Template Literals
Destructuring Assignment
Enhanced Object Literals
Promises
Classes
Modules

<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.5** What is the difference between **`let`** and **`const`** ? -->
<!-- Answer - Variable Reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned a new value
    . This means you can change the value stored in a let variable at any point after its
     initialization. For example:

javascript:-
let x = 10;
x = 20; // Valid: Reassigning the value of 'x'
On the other hand, variables declared with const are read-only and cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. Any attempt to reassign a const variable will result in a TypeError. For example:

javascript:-
const y = 10;
y = 20; // Invalid: Cannot reassign a 'const' variable -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.6**  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them? -->
<!-- Answer - Template literals are a new feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015/ ES6.
    It provides an easy way to create multiline strings and perform string interpolation.
    Template literals are the string literals and allow embedded expressions. Before ES6,
    template literals were called as template strings. -->



<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.7** Whatâ€™s difference between map & forEach? -->
<!-- Answer - The forEach() method does not returns a new array based on the given array. 
    The map() method returns an entirely new array. The forEach() method returns â€œundefinedâ€œ.
     The map() method returns the newly created array according to the provided callback 
     function -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.8** How can you destructure objects and arrays in ES6? -->
<!-- Answer - Destructuring Objects:
To destructure an object, you use curly braces {} and provide variable names that 
correspond to the object's property names. Here's an example:

const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  city: 'London'
};

// Destructuring the 'person' object
const { name, age, city } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: Alice
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(city); // Output: London

Destructuring Arrays:
Array destructuring allows you to extract values from an array into individual
variables based on their positions. You use square brackets [] to specify the variables to 
assign the values to. Here's an example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Destructuring the 'numbers' array
const [first, second, , fourth] = numbers;

console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(fourth); // Output: 4 -->


<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.9** How can you define default parameter values in ES6 functions? -->
<!-- answer - 
  function greet(name = 'Anonymous') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet(); // Output: Hello, Anonymous!
greet('Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!

In the example above, the greet function has a parameter called name with a default value of 
'Anonymous'. If no argument is provided when calling the function or if the argument is
 undefined, the default value is used. When calling greet() without an argument,
  it outputs "Hello, Anonymous!". When calling greet('Alice'), the provided argument "Alice"
   is used, and it outputs "Hello, Alice!". -->



<!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.10** What is the purpose of the spread operator (**`...`**) in ES6? -->
<!-- answer - The spread operator helps the iterable objects to expand into individual elements.
     Iterable objects are those on which we can use a loop, for example, Array, Map, Set, etc.
      In other words, the spread operator allows us to copy all elements from the existing array
       or object into another array or object -->
